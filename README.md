# An ERC20 token contract

This is an implementation of Ethereum's [ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) interface.
Please note that ERC20 has some fundamental flaws, many of which have been resolved with [ERC777](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-777).
This projects intents to serve as a simple example that token developers can familiarize with easily, not as a modern token contract.
